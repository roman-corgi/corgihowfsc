## Adding items to the general corgihowfsc TODO list

To add an idea or request to the general TODO list, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/roman-corgi/corgihowfsc/issues)
describing the problem. Add relevant labels where possible. Feel free to post in the #cpp-hardware Slack channel to
discuss the issue and see if anyone might be planning to address it.

## Contributing code

1. Create a branch off of the `main` branch.

2. Open a Draft PR early to enable discussion, track progress, and review changes via diffs.

In the PR:

- Link the related issue if there is one (e.g. Fixes #188).

- Provide a clear description of scope and expected changes, and keep it updated.

- Assign contributors and add labels. The assignee is responsible for completion.

- Before marking the PR as ready for review, ensure all work is complete: rebase, run tests, fix problems, and update documentation.

- Rebase regularly if the branch is long-lived. Ask for help on Slack if needed.

3. Request at least one review and iterate with the reviewer. You can post in the #cpp-hardware Slack channel to ask for reviewers if needed.

4. Address all review comments:

- Implement requested changes or create follow-up issues.

- Explain how each comment was handled.

- Request re-review when ready.

- Leave in-line comment resolution to the reviewer.

5. Once approved, the PR can be merged.
